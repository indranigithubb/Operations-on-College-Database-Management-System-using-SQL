# College-Database-Management-System-SQL

This project focuses on utilizing SQL Server Management Studio to run SQL queries in a college database's database management system. 
I ran all of the files in various query editors in the first section. 
SQL Joins, Union, Subqueries, and other operations are covered in the second section. 
In this part, simple DML queries like SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, and DELETE are employed. 
It also includes several tasks that use DDL (Data Definition Language) queries. 
Advanced SQL techniques are used and involve writing views, stored procedures, functions, and scripts. 
The final section, which deals with database design, contains two database designs that I created, one for a college database and the other for a website for a book. 
Additionally, this report includes comments on the project as well as some of the materials I used.
